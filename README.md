# CrewWealth

CrewWealth is an income planning tool designed for cruise ship crew and seafarers. It helps you understand what you really earn in a year – not just your base salary, but also overtime, tips, commissions, and bonuses – and turn that into a clear plan for saving and spending.

## What CrewWealth will do

- Estimate your **real yearly income** based on your rank, cruise line, contract length and typical extra earnings.
- Apply a simple **70/30 rule** so you know how much to save and how much you can safely spend.
- Show **3–5 year wealth projections** so you can see where you’re heading if you stay consistent.
- Help you plan for **vacation periods and contract gaps**, so you don’t run out of money between contracts.

## Who it is for

CrewWealth is built specifically for:
- ship officers and ratings  
- Hotel, F&B, retail, spa, casino and other onboard crew  
- Any seafarer with variable income who wants more control and less stress about money

## Project status

CrewWealth is currently in **early development / MVP stage**.  
The first version will focus on a simple web app with manual input and clear, easy-to-read income and savings projections.

More details, screenshots and onboarding information will be added as the project evolves.
