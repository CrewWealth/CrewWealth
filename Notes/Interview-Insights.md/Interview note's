# Market Research - CrewWealth

## Research Methodology
Conducted informal interviews with maritime crew members across different sectors and income structures to validate product-market fit and identify core pain points.

**Sample size:** 3 maritime professionals  
**Sectors represented:** Cruise operations, hotel/service roles  
**Experience range:** 3-15 years at sea  
**Income structures:** Fixed salary, variable (tips-based), hybrid models  

---

## Key Findings

### Pain Point 1: Lack of Spending Awareness
**Frequency:** 3/3 respondents  
**Description:** Maritime workers report spending money faster than planned during leave periods. Impulse purchases and social obligations (celebrations, family events) lead to uncontrolled spending.

**Quote examples:**
- "I spend money faster than planned when I'm home"
- "Don't track spending onboard or during vacation"
- "First month home I spend more than planned"

---

### Pain Point 2: Inability to Track Savings Progress
**Frequency:** 3/3 respondents  
**Description:** Workers set financial targets (e.g., €3,000-€100,000 goals) but do not track whether they are on pace to achieve them. Most cannot state annual savings amounts.

**Quote examples:**
- "I set targets but don't know if I hit them"
- "I don't know how much I save per year"
- "Hard to see if I'm on track financially"

---

### Pain Point 3: Income Variability Creates Planning Difficulty
**Frequency:** 2/3 respondents  
**Description:** Workers with variable income (tips, commissions, overtime) struggle to forecast earnings and plan long-term. This is especially acute for service/hospitality roles.

**Quote examples:**
- "One month high income from tips, next month at home I get €0"
- "Tips are unpredictable, can't plan scenarios"

---

### Pain Point 4: Long-term Financial Visibility
**Frequency:** 3/3 respondents  
**Description:** Maritime workers want to understand where they will be financially in 3-5 years but lack tools to model this accurately.

**Quote examples:**
- "Difficult to see where I'll be in 5 years"
- "Want to know if my spending continues, where I'll end up"

## Product Feature Validation

### Features Respondents Would Use
| Feature | Interest Level | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Monthly spending tracker | 3/3 (High) | Need visibility into where money goes |
| Target setting & tracking | 3/3 (High) | Want to measure progress toward goals |
| 5-year wealth projection | 3/3 (Medium-High) | Motivational, helps visualize outcomes |
| Scenario planning | 2/3 (Medium) | Useful for variable income workers |
| Budget allocation tool | 2/3 (Medium) | Want help dividing income into buckets |

### Features Respondents Would NOT Use
- Tax modeling (too complex)
- Inflation adjustments (not interested in complexity)
- Detailed contract gap planning (lower priority)

---

## Willingness to Pay
**Result:** 3/3 respondents indicated willingness to pay €3-5/month for a tool that helps them plan finances better.

**Reasoning:**
- "It will help me reach targets"
- "I want to see where I can create more income"
- "Consistency and knowing where I stand"

## Market Segments Identified

### Segment 1: Disciplined Savers (Fixed Income)
- **Profile:** Officers or senior crew with predictable salaries
- **Behavior:** Already budget and save systematically
- **Pain:** Lack long-term visibility; struggle with impulse spending during leave
- **Solution fit:** Long-term projections + spending awareness

### Segment 2: Target-Oriented (Variable Income, Lower Discipline)
- **Profile:** Service/operations crew with inconsistent income
- **Behavior:** Set goals but don't track; spending uncontrolled
- **Pain:** Don't know if on track; money runs out faster than expected
- **Solution fit:** Target dashboard + spending tracker

### Segment 3: High Earners (Variable Income, High Discipline)
- **Profile:** Senior service roles (hospitality, sales) with significant variable income
- **Behavior:** Already budget (e.g., 60/20/20 split) but lack forecasting tools
- **Pain:** Can't model scenarios (what if tips drop?); vacation income gaps
- **Solution fit:** Scenario planner + prognosis accuracy

## MVP Scope (Final)

### Core Features - Version 0.1
1. **Income input** (sector, position, base salary, variable income, contract length)
2. **Budget allocator** (set allocation %, see monthly breakdown)
3. **Spending/savings tracker** (log actual vs. target)
4. **5-year wealth projection** (compound growth at 7% assumed return)
5. **Scenario planner** (model income changes: +/- X%)

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Tax calculations
- Inflation modeling
- Complex contract gap analysis
- Mobile app (web-first MVP)
- Multi-currency (EUR only for MVP)

## Next Steps
1. Build MVP (Flask + Firebase, web app)
2. Beta test with interview participants
3. Launch to maritime forums/communities
4. Iterate based on user feedback
